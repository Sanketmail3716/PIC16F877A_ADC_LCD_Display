# PIC16F877A_ADC_LCD_Display
This project reads analog signals from two input channels (AN0 and AN2) using the ADC module of the PIC16F877A microcontroller and displays the converted digital values on a 16x2 LCD. Written in Embedded C using MPLAB and XC8, it's ideal for beginners learning ADC and LCD interfacing.
